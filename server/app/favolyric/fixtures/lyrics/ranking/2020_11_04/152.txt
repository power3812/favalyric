Feet in the sand
Cancel your plans
We only got one life
Let's live it while we can
Don't be afraid
Let's ride the wave
And if you fall
I promise I'ma keep you safe
Don't let go
 don't let go
Even when the seasons change
I won't let go
 won't let go
Tell me that you feel the same
Do you remember how I stayed awake
Watchin' the sun come up to light your face
In the summer
 in the summer
Oh
 oh
 oh
 oh
 yeah
Do you remember how I held you close
And I made sure you never got too cold
In the summer
 in the summer
Oh
 oh
 oh
 oh
 yeah
Keepin' our dreams and hopes up high
Baby let's dance tonight
Reachin' up to the sky
Keepin' our hearts alive
In the summer
 in the summer
Oh
 oh
 oh
 oh
 yeah
見つめて　引き寄せる
Keep living in the moment that's what it's about
呼吸の音(ね)も　Too close
Life is beautiful
キミとだから　Naked love then...
Always know
 always know
My feelings they won't ever fade
And even when the rain
Turns to snow
We will always be the same
肌と肌　触れ　Million Kisses
此れ以上ない　A season's tale
In the summer
 in the summer
Oh
 oh
 oh
 oh
 yeah
二人　溶けて行く　Hottest Temp
捉えようのない　愛しさへ
In the summer
 in the summer
Oh
 oh
 oh
 oh
 yeah
蒸発しそうな　雫を
冷ます　このSea Tide
何もかもが Fine
酔いしれたい　All times
In the summer
 in the summer
Oh
 oh
 oh
 oh
 yeah
Right by your side
Yeah you know that I ain't gonna leave
So keep your dreams and hopes forever
Sparks in your eyes and it hits me so hard it's unreal
Cuz we were meant to be together
Do you remember how I stayed awake
Watchin' the sun come up to light your face
In the summer
 in the summer
Oh
 oh
 oh
 oh
 yeah
Do you remember how I held you close
And I made sure you never got too cold
In the summer
 in the summer
Oh
 oh
 oh
 oh
 yeah
Keepin' our dreams and hopes up high
Baby let's dance tonight
Reachin' up to the sky
Keepin' our hearts alive
In the summer
 in the summer
Oh
 oh
 oh
 oh
 yeah
