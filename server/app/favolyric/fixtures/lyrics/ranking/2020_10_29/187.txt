例えば　キミが側に居なくても
I never mind I never mind [Gotta let you go]
What if I left here and it made no sense
and I never mind I never mind [Oh Baby Girl]
I know It's too late to take back those words that have hurt you
今更　言えない[Sorry]
Wish I could get you back…
You were mine
 I made you cry
不器用にloved you so deep
When you were mine
I treated you bad
I blamed you like a thousand times
I just need one more shot at second chances for me
素直にもなれずに
I know that let you down
You were never mine
You were never mine
You gotta go 僕は独り
You were never mine
If I can't have you

Let love set you free
I care about you baby
I miss you baby 今ならば treat you right
Every single piece of the blame you want to me
受け止め　I'll change my mind
Girl oh
Can we go back the way we used to be
何度でも諦めず down on my knee
Better nights
 better times
しがみついては　it'll break my heart
Every moment without you
情けなくなるほどに
Every time I think of you

It always burns me out
You were mine
 I made you cry
不器用にloved you so deep
When you were mine
I treated you bad
I blamed you like a thousand times
I just need one more shot at second chances for me
素直にもなれずに
I know that let you down
You were never mine
You were never mine
You gotta go 僕は独り
You were never mine
If I can't have you

Let love set you free
You were never mine
You gotta go 僕は独り
You were never mine
If I can't have you

Let love set you free girl
