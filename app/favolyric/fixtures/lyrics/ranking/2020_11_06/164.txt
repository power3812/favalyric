We don't have to be together
We could even be a thousand miles apart
This I promise you forever
I'll always be the light that gets you out the dark
No matter the time
No matter the place
There's nothing in this world
Taht could stand in my way
I'll come running wherever you are
My love for you ain't never gonna change
I'll come running wherever you are
Whenever you call
Girl whenever you call my name
I never said it would be easy
But your lovin is a love worth fighting for
And girl I'll fight for your heart all night and all day
Forever and more
No matter the time
No matter the place
There's nothing in this world
Taht could stand in my way
I'll come running wherever you are
My love for you ain't never gonna change
I'll come running wherever you are
Whenever you call
Girl whenever you call my name
You don't have to worry
No no no no no
I'll be there in a hurry
Gonna catch you if you fall
Promise Imma give my all
Let me be
Let me be
Let me be the one that you call
I'll come running wherever you are
My love for you ain't never gonna change
I'll come running wherever you are
Whenever you call
Girl whenever you call my name
