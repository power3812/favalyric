はじけりゃ Yea！　素直に Good！
だからちょいと重いのは Boo！
That's all right！
それでも時代を極める　そうさボクらは　Super Boy！
We are “COOL”
やな事あってもどっかでカッコつける
やるだけやるけどいいでしょ？
夢だけ持ったっていいでしょ？
No one can take away your dream
You are my soul soul
 shaker
You've taken me on a ride
Oh you you
 only you
Heve always been here by my side
Crazy
 crazy
You're filling me with energy
You are the wind
A-RA-SHI
 A-RA-SHI
My dream
集う雲　slowly flow
shout out to the world
hey we are the storm
僕ら未だ　まだ見てる
でっかい愛とか希望探してる
everyday everybody
the sky's the limit (yes the sky's the limit)
いまこそ始めてみるしかない
Let's get it on
 Let's get it on yeah
そう　始めてみればいいじゃない
Step by step
I'm gonna give it all I got
And then I push a little harder
Day by day
I'm getting closer closer to my destiny
It's waiting there for me
Don't stop me now
Don't stop me now
You better get ready！
You are my soul soul

You've taken me on a ride
Oh you you

You're filling me with energy
You are the wind

My dream
激しい嵐　凄まじい騒ぎ
駆け抜ければ　瞬く灯り (yeah)
天を飛び交う 5clouds gonna
Fly away
Step by step
I'm gonna give it all I got
And then I push a little harder
Day by day
I'm getting closer closer to my destiny
It's waiting there for me
Don't stop me now
Don't stop me now
You better get ready！
