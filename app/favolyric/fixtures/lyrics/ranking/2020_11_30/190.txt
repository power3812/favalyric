You must be sweaty
Cause you've been running through my mind
Lil'sour
 lil'sweet
Perfect balance makes you complete
Just what I want (wow)
Can't get enough (wow)
Thirsty
 so thirsty
Yeah craving just one tall glass full
Got me some lemons
 one thing left to do
Gimme that Gimme that Lemonade
 Lemonade (ay ay ay)
Drink it up Drink it up time to play
 time to play (ay ay ay)
Baby girl you're my baby girl
Little more sip and you're my world
Gimme that Gimme that Lemonade
 Lemonade (ay ay ay)
Crazy days and crazy nights
We can just chill and put it on some ice
Take you places you've never been
Up all night trying to drink again
Just what I want (wow)
Can't get enough (wow)
Thirsty
 so thirsty
Yeah craving just one tall glass full
Got me some lemons
 one thing left to do
Gimme that Gimme that Lemonade
 Lemonade (ay ay ay)
Drink it up Drink it up time to play
 time to play (ay ay ay)
Baby girl you're my baby girl
Little more sip and you're my world
Gimme that Gimme that Lemonade
 Lemonade (ay ay ay)
So right
 so wrong
But in all the best possible ways
It's been
 too long
These nights got me feeling I'm insane
So right
 so wrong
Drink it up cause I need my refill now
Drink it up cause I need my refill now
All up
 all up
 all up
Thirsty
 so thirsty
Yeah craving just one tall glass full
Got me some lemons
 one thing left to do
Gimme that Gimme that Lemonade
 Lemonade (ay ay ay)
Drink it up Drink it up time to play
 time to play (ay ay ay)
Baby girl you're my baby girl
Little more sip and you're my world
Gimme that Gimme that Lemonade
 Lemonade (ay ay ay)
