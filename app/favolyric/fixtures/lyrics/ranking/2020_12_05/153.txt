I can tell by the way you walk
 you got that fire
Imma put yo love on top
 what's your desire？
Know you got some
 I'll fulfill them
Girl I know everything it takes to get you higher
She put her hands up
 I lost control
Her body dancing across the floor
I can't get around her
Love I found her
Someone crown her
Gimme that gimme that
 give that pleasure
I know you wanna dance
What's up？
All it really takes is one touch
I can bet you now
You won't get enough
Gimme that gimme that

Move around some

Girl I bet I got all the things it takes to get you higher
She put her hands up
 I lost control
Her body dancing across the floor
I can't get around her
Love I found her
Someone crown her
Gimme that gimme that
 give that pleasure
I know you wanna dance
What's up？
All it really takes is one touch
I can bet you now
You won't get enough
Gimme that gimme that
