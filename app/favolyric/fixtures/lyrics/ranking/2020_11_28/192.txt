We've been waitin' too long
We been waitin' to feel it
We've been holdin' it down
Now we're high on the ceilin'
We keep dancin' around
Clap ya hands if you mean it
Do you need it Do you need it now
We been here Through the hard times
Never lost focus
Still here Now it's alright
Everything golden
So here we Here we go
It's time to Free ya soul
We're party starters We're party starters
We got those good vibes We're going all night
We're party starters We're party harder
We goin' sky high We're going all night
All night long
少しだけ monologue
wiz American hot dog
this is the protocol
I want to know it
you can not go home yet.
We can control
We'll look back and want more
comfortable uncomfortable
It doesn't matter もう uncontrollable
Everyone havin' fun
Bouncin' down in the Six Four
その笑顔は　きっと
Someday　かけがえない　Sceneに
Feel the beat of the drums
Clap ya hands it you feel me
Do you feel me　感じて…　さぁ！
We're party starters We're party starters
We got those good vibes We're going all night
ねぇ、このまま　一緒にTurn up
やがてTime flies by　だから今は
All night long
Party Party Starters Starters
Ay yo
Party Party Starters Starters
Ay yo
Who got the funk We got the funk
Who got the funk We got the funk
You Me Us We
Shake shake shake your body down
We're party starters We're party starters
We got those good vibes We're going all night
We're party starters We're party harder
We goin' sky high We're going all night
All night long
