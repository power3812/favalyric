gotta get it homie gotta move it
if you gonna do it then　他二の次
everybody just talk nobody really do it
なんならやるまでしとけよ秘密に
誰かと確認なんて不要
自分のジャッジだけでbrake the walls
ド派手なfakeやろうより
cool にlow にprove them wrong
I won't give up the fight in my life
cause my life is living for love
And I won't give up the fight in my life
stand off and groove on time
Tokyo prison
I'm going to relight your feeling
when time gets rough
night and day are fading
I'm going to relight your feeling
there's no time to explain
Oh nothing is for real
That's how you make me feel
I got beaten
 stompin'on love
pick up my wasted time
Oh god might understand.
nobody can't hold me down
I won't give up the fight in my life
cause my life is living for love
And I won't give up the fight in my life
stand off and groove on time
Tokyo prison
I'm going to relight your feeling
when time gets rough
night and day has are blending
I'm going to relight your feeling
light up every last one of them
またTime is Ticking　唯一平等Wasting No More
計画ならDoneするまでNot Real
The Illest　頂く称号
誰かの予想軽々超えてはるか向こう
I've done it　あれもこれもそれも
もしDownしてもupしてOn and On
東京HellからParadise
そりゃ勝ちとるためならGotta Fight
今更やわなかけできるわけねぇだろぶちかませ
頭の中から現実に
変換していく綿密に
眠らずAction　0時過ぎ
このLifeが生み出す芸術品
Oh nothing is for real
That's how you make me feel
I got beaten
 stompin'on love
pick up my wasted time
Oh god might understand.
nobody can't hold me down
And I won't give up the fight in my life
cusee my life is living for love
And I won't give up the fight in my life
stand and groove on time
Tokyo prison
I'm going to relight your feeling
when time gets rough
night and day are fading
I'm going to relight your feeling
there's no time to explain
Lost in paradise
night and day are fading out
when time gets rough
access to your love
Lost in paradise
night and day are fading out
keep on dance now
hey hey
Tokyo prison
I'm going to relight your feeling
night and day are fading
I'm going to relight your feeling
light up every last one of them
Lost in paradise
night and day are fading out
when time gets rough
access to your love
Lost in paradise
night and day are fading out
keep on dance now
hey hey hey hey hey
