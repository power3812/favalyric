It doesn't matter to me whether it's all rain or full of sunshine
You piss me off
 I love you a lot
To me
 they both mean the same
I meet really cruel guys and sweet angels too
 like all of the time
And they're always around
 they're all crazy too

I hope you know what I mean
I've got something to say
To everybody
 fuck you
It's been on my mind
You know I meant it with love
I just thought it'd be fun
Went through a whole lot so fuck this
They all mean the same thing
 you know
We alright
 change it up
 do your thing
Let's be real for a sec
 I think you'll relate

we feel down often too
Mistakes that were made
 the love that we ate

they all share a lovely home
Anywho why don't we just karaoke？ You'll be Scarlett
 I'm Bill
I wanna show you this really cool song
 c'mon
 let's fuck shit up
I've got something to say
To everybody
 fuck you
It's been on my mind
You know I meant it with love
I just thought it'd be fun
Went through a whole lot so fuck this
They all mean the same thing
 you know
We alright
 change it up
 do your thing
Wabi sabi
Make it messy
I've got something to say
To everybody
 fuck you
It's been on my mind
You know I meant it with love
I just thought it'd be fun
Went through a whole lot so fuck this
They all mean the same thing
 you know
We alright
 change it up
 do your thing
