It's getting late in the night
And a long skirt runs down my legs
It's getting late in the night
See me stumbling and tripping
It's getting late in the night
Some twisted lingerie that fades
It's getting late in the night
A sewn dress that's unraveling
So come expose the void
Invisible hands
Untouchable eyes
Voices cry out loud
And all becomes one
Sometimes a little girl has a beautiful heart
And even if its strong it still gets dirty
Oh
 Don't run away
A lost night on the planet
Every spark you thought you felt was a lie
A shit night on the planet
Everything you've known is an illusion
Doesn't matter how cute you are
It doesn't matter how pretty you are
No
 I don't need your broken words
I'm falling so fast into the night
Are your numbers falling too？
I'm falling so fast into the night
Please don't like me anymore now
I'm falling so fast into the night
All of the sheets are just so bloody
I'm falling so fast into the night
I want to feel all your shame
So come expose your love
If you wanna live
If you wanna fight
It feels so empty
To hurt all at once
Don't wanna die if we haven't met our resolutions
I just wanna feel the spark again
Or anything at all
Or anything at all
A wrong night on the planet
You control the way the darkness bleeds through
A shit night on the planet
It's never-ending if I stay with you
Looking at the moratorium fools I've fought and ran from everyday
But things change
Things can change
Change
Sometimes there is a rare star that is stuck between day and night
I want it to shoot and burn in rage throughout  this night forever
Make me shine

Like shit
Fake is so pretty
It looks like it's shining
All the machine can do is reflect the sun
A lost night on the planet
Every spark you thought you felt was a lie
A shit night on the planet
Every love you've known is an illusion
A lost night on the planet
Every spark you thought you felt was a lie
A shit night on the planet
You can feel it deep inside your body
A lost night on the planet
A shit night on the planet
A lost night on the planet
A shit night on the planet
